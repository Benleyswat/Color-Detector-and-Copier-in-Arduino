# Color-Detector-and-Copier-in-Arduino
This is an Aruino project which copies a detected color and lights up an RGB lamp if connected properly.

Its documentation is Hungarian but I write it down here briefly in English.

We used an Arduino Mega 2560 and a Color-2-Click Light sensor in the middle and an RGB lamp at the 11,12,13,GND ports.

The project has a LabWiev part as well which allows to run the program from the LabWiev.
The Arduino (.INO) file runs the main loop and detecting.

Hope this project runs on other computers as well.
